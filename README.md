## Intro  

(paraphrased by Cluade) 

I have audited or completed homework assignments for several course materials and research papers, which may or may not represent the entire collection. The creators of these courses generously shared their knowledge with the public. For those interested in getting started with Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep Learning, CS182 is an excellent entry point, provided you have some prerequisites, such as basic Python programming skills and university-level mathematics.

In the Deep Learning community, acronyms are widely used. For example, Latent Variable Model (LVM), Autoregressive (AR), Autoencoder (AE), and Masked Auto Encoder (MAE), among others. 

When learning about Deep Learning, consider following the advice of John Schulman, which includes reading textbooks alongside research papers. Textbooks often provide a more comprehensive and condensed version of many ideas, while research papers typically focus on a single concept in depth. Courses in that context are like textbooks, especially if it's given by people like Sergey Levine or Pieter Abbeel.

I have arranged these research papers by the date of their last revision as of May 31, 2024. For example, "Attention Is All You Need" was originally published in 2017, but the latest revision was on August 2, 2017. Although these revisions are often minor, it wouldn't be a bad idea to revisit them sometimes. This is especially true for survey papers.

If you have any additional resources that you want to include, please feel free to submit a pull request
