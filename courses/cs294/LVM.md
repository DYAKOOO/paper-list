You might have noticed that some of the papers listed here also appear in other sections, such as the Flow and Autoregressive sections. This is because certain papers combine different approaches, such as Latent Variable Models (LVMs) with Autoregressive (AR) models or LVMs with Flow-based models.

For instance, the Variational Lossy Autoencoder paper combines the concepts of LVMs and AR models. In this case, the autoencoder (an LVM) is augmented with an autoregressive component to capture more complex dependencies in the data.

Similarly, the paper "Improving Variational Inference with Inverse Autoregressive Flow" introduces a technique called Inverse Autoregressive Flow, which enhances variational inference in LVMs like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By incorporating a flow-based model into the VAE framework, the authors aim to improve the expressiveness and flexibility of the latent variable representation. This approach effectively combines LVMs with Flow-based models.
